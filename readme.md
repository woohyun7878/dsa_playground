I made this repository  to permanently store my solutions to common coding interview problems that I may need to brush up on some time in the future.

*You can look for additional information about each problem in Study Notes.xlsx. Problems are categorized into the following categories.*
- Arrays & Strings
- Linked Lists
- Trees & Graphs
- Backtracking
- Sorting & Searching
- Dynamic Programming
- Design
- Misc
